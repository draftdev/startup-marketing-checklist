One of the first things I do when making a [marketing plan](/marketing-checklist) for a new project is to come up with as many blog post ideas as I can. This may sound premature, but having these ideas will prevent you from getting [creative exhaustion](http://www.writingandwellness.com/2015/09/08/battling-creative-exhaustion-how-to-refill-the-well/) or from not having anything to write about each week. A healthy backlog of creative blog post ideas is also a great first step to a content marketing calendar.
