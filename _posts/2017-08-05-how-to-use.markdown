I've been trying to make marketing my side projects as simple as checking a few boxes off a list every week. While I realize that this isn't going to make my side projects market leaders, it is a **lean way to build traction and gain users.**
 
 The reason I've failed at marketing in the past is that I made it too complicated, so the [side project marketing checklist](/marketing-checklist) I created aims to fix that. Here's how I've been using it to market my side projects:

## 1. I Copy the [checklist](/marketing-checklist) to a new [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com)

Gists are great because they're just a simple way to store markdown files and you can make checklists in them, share them, and keep a revision history of them. When I started marketing this project, I copied the [raw markdown file of the checklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing/master/marketing-checklist.md) into [a Gist](https://gist.github.com/karllhughes/56153edea80f2c735a0b8f57ff0eba94#file-1-side-project-marketing-checklist-md).

## 2. Customize the checklist

Next, I removed some things that weren't relevant. For example, the [section on social media](http://localhost:4000/marketing-checklist/#social-media) wasn't relevant to this project because I didn't want to set up Twitter and Facebook accounts for it yet.

I then modified some of the items that were applicable. For example, instead of making a list of tech blogs for my [PR preparations](http://localhost:4000/marketing-checklist/#pr-preparations), I am making a list of startup and small business marketing blogs. I'm subscribing to them, and later I'll pitch some of them for guest posts or leave comments on them.

Finally, I started adding some custom lists like the huge list of [places to post this project](https://gist.github.com/karllhughes/56153edea80f2c735a0b8f57ff0eba94#file-2-places-to-post-md) and some early [blog post ideas](https://gist.github.com/karllhughes/56153edea80f2c735a0b8f57ff0eba94#file-3-blog-ideas-md). I like Gists because you can have multiple files without needing to set up a whole new repository for them.

## 3. Get to work!

Every week I try to knock one or two big items off my list. I'm also starting to break some of the recurring items up into things I want to do daily and monthly. Eventually I'll put reminders in my calendar so that these things become automatic.

## 4. Monitor performance and optimize

As I start to get a little traction for my project, I'll come up with a few KPIs - important metrics that I want to track and improve. It's silly to start obsessing over these before you have any users, but once you get some traction, optimization can lead to huge gains.
